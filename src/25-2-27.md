# InnoDB
- for InnoDB, each node is a block in disk, the size of each node is 16kb
- Only leaf nodes contain the real data, non-leaf nodes only contain the index and ref to children nodes
- Leaf nodes are connected via bidrectional pointers, and are sorted.
- Mysql will create a seperate file Secondary index, whereas primary index share the same file with real data
- Primary index, mysql will store entire row data at the the leaf node, whereas for scondary index, only primary key will be stored
- Why do we propose using incrementing primary key? Avoid B+ tree breaking nodes too often.
